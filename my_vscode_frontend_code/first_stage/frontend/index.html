    Leadership is one area many wish to occupy and even attempt some 
positions in society,business and even in small gatherings, but few
seem to take the pain and hard work to really look out what leadership 
truely entails.

         <h3 title="Leadership talk" style="font-size: 22px;">Let's Talk LeaderShip</h3>
<pre style="font-family: 'unset';font-size: medium;">
<blockquote><em>
        “True leadership cannot be awarded, appointed, or assigned. 
    It comes only from <b><em>influence</em></b>, and that cannot be mandated. It must 
    be earned. The only thing a title can buy is a little time-either 
    to increase your level of influence with others or to undermine it.” 
</em></blockquote>
</pre>
<pre style="font-size: 20px; font-family: 'Gill Sans'">
<q>Leadership is influence.</q> Just because someone has a title, doesn’t mean
that person is a leader.“When it comes to identifying a real leader… 
The proof of leadership is found in the followers.”
There are several factors that can attribute to emerging as a leader.
</pre>   
<p>Let's detail out just a few.</p>
<ol>
    <li>Character – Who They Are
    “True leadership always begins with the inner person.”3
    
    The character of a leader will filter into the entire organization and its employees. Great character will create potential for a great organization. But, it all begins with the leader’s heart.</li>
    
    <li>Relationships – Who They Know
    “Build the right kinds of relationships with the right people, and you can become the real leader in an organization.”4
    
    In your sphere of influence, you must develop deep, meaningful relationships that go beyond seeing someone daily because you simply work in the same office. Relationships grow loyalty, influence and ultimately the business.</li>
    
    <li>Knowledge – What They Know
    “Whenever I was new to an organization, I always spent a lot of time doing homework before I tried to take the lead.”
    
    New environments bring about questions to be answered. By seeking knowledge before demanding a leadership position, leaders have the chance to learn first, lead second. </li>

    Leadership is one area many wish to occupy and even attempt some 
positions in society,business and even in small gatherings, but few
seem to take the pain and hard work to really look out what leadership 
truely entails.

<blockquote id="hard_work"><em>
    “True leadership cannot be awarded, appointed, or assigned. It comes 
only from <b><em>influence</em></b>, and that cannot be mandated. It must be
earned. The only thing a title can buy is a little time-either to increase 
your level of influence with others or to undermine it.” 
</em></blockquote>
</pre>
<p style="font-size: 18px; font-family: 'Gill Sans'">
    <q>Leadership is influence.</q> Just because someone has a title, doesn’t mean
    that person is a leader.“When it comes to identifying a real leader… 
    The proof of leadership is found in the followers.”
    There are several factors that can attribute to emerging as a leader.
</p>   

<p id="c4">Let's detail out just a few.</p>
<ol id="ol">
    <li>Character – Who They Are
    “True leadership always begins with the inner person.”
    
    The character of a leader will filter into the 
    entire organization and its employees. Great 
    character will create potential for a great 
    organization. But, it all begins with the 
    leader’s heart.</li>
    
    <li>Relationships – Who They Know
    “Build the right kinds of relationships with the right people, and you can become 
    the real leader in an organization.”
    
    In your sphere of influence, you must develop
    deep, meaningful relationships that go 
    beyond seeing someone daily because you simply 
    work in the same office. Relationships grow 
    loyalty, influence and ultimately the business.</li>
    
    <li>Knowledge - What They Know
    “Whenever I was new to an organization, I always spent a lot of time doing homework
    before I tried to take the lead.”
    
    New environments bring about questions to be answered. By seeking knowledge before demanding a leadership position, leaders have 
    the chance to learn first, lead second. </li>   
    <li>Innovation and creativity - Creativity is typically centered around original thought and knowledge, which unleashes potential and is an integral part
        of idea generation. Innovation, on the other hand, is used 
        to turn the creative idea that you come up with into a viable solution for the team.</li>
    <li>Integrity sets leaders apart from the rest. Without integrity, you cannot prevail for long 
        because it is the trademark of good leadership. Integrity is a core 
        quality to flourish as a successful leader. You cannot thrive if you lack integrity. A good leader 
        understands the values of beliefs and values and does not believe in 
        false promises for short-term gains or abiding shortcuts to success. No matter how hard a situation, a good leader delivers ethically 
        on merit without compromising on principles. </li>

    </ol>
